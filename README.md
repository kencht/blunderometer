## üì¶ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Stockfish chess engine

### 1. Install Stockfish Chess Engine

**macOS (with Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install stockfish
```

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install stockfish
```

**Windows:**
1. Download from [Stockfish official site](https://stockfishchess.org/download/)
2. Extract and add to your PATH, or note the installation location

### 2. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/timkench/blunderometer.git
cd blunderometer

# Setup Python backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setup React frontend
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### 3. Verify Setup (Optional)

Run the setup checker to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
python check_setup.py
```

This will check your Python version, Node.js, Stockfish installation, and all dependencies.

### 4. Configure Stockfish (if needed)

If Stockfish is not in your PATH or in `/opt/homebrew/bin/stockfish`, edit `game_analyzer.py`:

```python
# Line 12-15: Update this path to match your Stockfish installation
engine_path = "/your/path/to/stockfish"  # Update this line
```

Common paths:
- **macOS Homebrew**: `/opt/homebrew/bin/stockfish`
- **Ubuntu**: `/usr/bin/stockfish`  
- **Windows**: `C:\Path\To\stockfish.exe`

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Move Classifications
- **Blunder**: Moves losing ‚â•300 centipawns (major mistakes)
- **Mistake**: Moves losing ‚â•100 centipawns (significant errors)
- **Inaccuracy**: Moves losing ‚â•50 centipawns (minor imprecisions)

### Performance Metrics
- **Games Analyzed**: Total games with complete analysis
- **Average Centipawn Loss**: Overall accuracy metric
- **Error Distribution**: Breakdown by time control and rating
- **Improvement Trends**: Track progress over time

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

**Analysis Settings:**
- **Games to Fetch**: 25-200 games per batch
- **Per Game Time**: 10-60 seconds per game (balance speed vs accuracy)
- **Total Session Time**: 300-1800 seconds (optional session limit)

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Quick Analysis**: 10s per game, 600s total (10 minutes max)
- **Balanced**: 20s per game, no total limit (default)
- **Deep Analysis**: 45s per game, no total limit (most accurate)

### üéØ Analysis Features

- **Real-time Progress**: Watch games being analyzed with countdown timers
- **Time Management**: Set per-game limits to balance speed vs accuracy  
- **Session Control**: Use total time limits for quick analysis sessions
- **Detailed Tracking**: See current game being analyzed and completion stats
- **Multi-User Support**: Each username gets its own separate database

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Concurrent Usage

Blunderometer supports true concurrent multi-user operation:

- **Simultaneous Analysis**: Up to 2 users can analyze games at the same time
- **Per-User State Tracking**: Each user's operations are tracked independently
- **Resource Management**: CPU usage is controlled to prevent server overload
- **Browser Support**: Any number of users can browse their stats simultaneously

For more details on the concurrency model, see [CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md).

### üîß Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Stockfish not found" error:**
   - Install Stockfish: `brew install stockfish` (macOS) or `sudo apt install stockfish` (Linux)
   - Update path in `game_analyzer.py` line 12-15

2. **"Port already in use" error:**
   - Kill existing processes: `pkill -f "python app.py"` and `pkill -f "npm start"`
   - Try different ports in `app.py` (line 475) and restart

3. **Games not fetching:**
   - Check your Lichess username is correct (case-sensitive)
   - Ensure you have public games on Lichess
   - Try fetching fewer games (25 instead of 200)

4. **Analysis stuck/slow:**
   - Reduce per-game time limit (try 10-15 seconds)
   - Add a total session time limit
   - Check Stockfish is working: `stockfish` in terminal should open the engine

5. **Frontend won't start:**
   - Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
   - Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
   - Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
