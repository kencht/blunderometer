## Adding the Dashboard Screenshot

To complete the README, please:

1. Save the screenshot of your Blunderometer dashboard as `dashboard.png` in this folder
2. The screenshot should show:
   - Performance metrics (games, blunder rate, accuracy)
   - Game loading section with analysis controls
   - Time control analysis charts
   - Performance trends over time
